### Current Projects

#### Secure Machine Learning

#### Computer Vision
 
#### Improved Fourier Reconstruction using Jump Information with Applications to MRI
I spent the last summer at Michigan State University's SURIEM Math REU [(program homepage)](http://lymanbriggs.msu.edu/SURIEM/).  I specifically worked in a team with three other undergraduates under Professors Aditya Viswanathan, Mark Iwen, and Tsveta Sendova on improving Medical Resonance Imaging with Fourier Analysis.  You can see our project site [here](https://sites.google.com/site/suriem2016mathmri/home), a technical report [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03764), and our code on bitbucket [here](https://bitbucket.org/charms/fourierrecon).    



#### DAAS
For my Internet Scale Applications class, I am working with [Sam Havron](havron.xyz) and [Monica Kuo](https://github.com/mdk6jd) to create a "Drones as a Service" marketplace.  This is a dockerized, 4-tier web app build using Django.  Check out the code on github [here](https://github.com/samuelhavron/daas).

#### zk-SNARKS: Theory and Practice
For a class project of Professor Mohammad Mahmoody's "Foundations of Cryptography Class", I will be exploring with [Sam Havron](https://havron.xyz/) how **zk-SNARKS** work at both a practical (specifically as used by [Zcash](https://z.cash/)) and theoretical  level. 

#### High School Programming Challenge
This year, I am serving on [ACM@UVA's](http://acm.cs.virginia.edu/) executive board as HSPC Head Judge.  Every year, our ACM hosts a ICPC-like competition for high schools throughout Virginia.  I am in charge of coming up with the problems and making sure nothing goes too badly!


### Previous Projects

#### Pickup
At Hack.UVA 2015, I worked in a team of three to create a pickup-sports app for Android.

#### Mindr
At MedHacks 2016, I worked in a team of four to create a medical appointment reminder app. (Code to be released) 

#### GhostHunter
In CS 2110: Software Development Methods, I led a team of three other students to create a PAC-MAN-esque game for Android.  I focused primarily on the backend, and became very familiar with asynchronous processing.

#### zk-SNARKS: Theory and Practice
For a class project of Professor Mohammad Mahmoody's "Foundations of Cryptography Class", I will be exploring with [Sam Havron](havron.xyz) how **zk-SNARKS** work at both a practical (specifically as used by [zCash](z.cash)) and theoretical  level. 

#### High School Programming Challenge
This year, I am serving on [ACM@UVA's](http://acm.cs.virginia.edu/) executive board as HSPC Head Judge.  Every year, our ACM hosts a ICPC-like competition for high schools throughout Virginia.  I am in charge of coming up with the problems and making sure nothing goes too badly!
